##  ðŸ“– **Abount**

The **Technology Institute** is a personal project that I developed to improve my skills and acquire more knowledge, it was a very cool project to do, because it is a complete project with database, back end and front end. When developing this project I had the opportunity to learn a little about the back end and it was very cool, and I believe that I am getting more and more experienced with the use of **React and NextJS.**
